Create audio files from .txt
Create audi files from txt files (UTF-8) using OpenAI API. Optimized for academic texts as it does a little tiny bit of text pre-processing (skipping references etc). You can get more information on available OpenAI voiceover voices here: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech You need an OpenAI API key: https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview For now, the script only allows for .txt file input in UTF-8. So if you have a .docx file, first save it as .txt in UTF-8 encoding. And obviously it is not good practice to store your API key in the script.
